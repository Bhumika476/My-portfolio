The journey to Everest Base Camp takes trekkers through Sagarmatha National Park, passing through picturesque villages like Namche Bazaar, Tengboche, and Dingboche. Along the way, travelers encounter stunning landscapes, ancient monasteries, and the warm hospitality of the Sherpa people.

The route follows the Dudh Koshi River, crossing suspension bridges and ascending through rugged terrain. Acclimatization days in Namche Bazaar and Dingboche help trekkers adjust to the high altitude, reducing the risk of altitude sickness. The final stretch to base camp leads through Gorakshep, the last settlement before reaching the glacier-covered camp. Many trekkers also hike to Kala Patthar (5,545 meters/18,192 feet) for a spectacular sunrise view of Everest.
